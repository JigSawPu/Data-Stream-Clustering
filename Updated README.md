	<h1>Data Stream Clustering</h1>
	<p>This repository contains 3 primary algorithms:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>CoreSetTree.ipynb</li>
		<li>PDCDP.ipynb</li>
		<li>minibatchPDCDP.ipynb</li>
	</ol>
  <p>There is also a supplementary folder that contains many algorithms to help understand the primary algorithms.<br> 
<em>Note*</em> I have not added any comments in any primary algorithms because the code is already too complex but<br> I've created a documentation style report for each primary algorithm to explain their working line by line. The documentation also contains theory for stream clustering and the necessary mathematics and pseudo code.</p>
